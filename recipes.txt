1. Eggs Benedict:
Ingredients:
- 4 large eggs
- 2 English muffins, split and toasted
- 4 slices Canadian bacon
- Hollandaise sauce:
  - 3 large egg yolks
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
  - Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:
1. Poach eggs: Bring a pot of water to a boil, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Crack eggs into separate small bowls, then carefully slide them into the water. Cook for 3-4 minutes until whites are set but yolks are still runny. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
2. Assemble: Place toasted English muffin halves on plates. Top each with a slice of Canadian bacon and a poached egg.
3. Make Hollandaise sauce: In a blender, combine egg yolks and lemon juice. Blend on high for a few seconds until frothy. While blending, slowly stream in melted butter until sauce is thick and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Spoon Hollandaise sauce over each egg and serve immediately.
